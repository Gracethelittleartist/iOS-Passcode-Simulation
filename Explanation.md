Basically my goal for this project is to make a functional iOS passcode simulator that looks the same as the real screen, with the background image (which I will upload shortly), keys that will fade for an instant when tapped, an input that will show the circles that change color when something is typed into it, and a working clock (not hard to do), fake battery charge, and etc. and find a way to load the html on my iPad as a prank for someone to enter their passcodes on (Just kidding, I'm simply trying to emulate as a way to get used to coding!)
